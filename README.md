Hi, I’m @R533-Code.
I mainly use `C++`, with occasional SIMD programming.

Right now, I am creating my own programing language, `Colt`, whose [compiler](https://github.com/R533-Code/colt-lang) is written in `C++`.

I had to roll out a few custom utilities to simplify writing that project (better Unicode support, custom allocators and data structures, and some OS abstractions). Check them out at [Colt-Cpp](https://github.com/R533-Code/colt-cpp).
